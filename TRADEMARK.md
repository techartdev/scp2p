## 1. What is trademarked

The following are trademarks of Tech Art Ltd:

- The name **"SCP2P"**
- Any logos, wordmarks, or iconography officially distributed with this
  repository under the `assets/` or `branding/` directories (when present).

The source code itself is licensed under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0** and
may be freely used, modified, and redistributed under its terms. This trademark
policy applies **only** to the project name and associated branding — it does
not restrict any right granted by the MPL-2.0.

## 2. Permitted uses (no permission needed)

You **may** use the name "SCP2P" without prior written permission in the
following situations:

| Use case | Example |

| Referring to the upstream project | "Built on SCP2P" / "Compatible with SCP2P" |
| Academic or journalistic discussion | "SCP2P is a peer-to-peer protocol that…" |
| Unmodified redistribution | Packaging the official release for a Linux distribution |
| Links or citations to the canonical repository | `https://github.com/techartdev/scp2p` |

In all cases you must not imply that Tech Art Ltd endorses or sponsors your
product or service unless a separate written agreement exists.

## 3. Uses that require permission

You **must** obtain written permission from Tech Art Ltd before:

- Distributing a **modified** version of SCP2P under the original name ("SCP2P")
  without clearly marking it as a fork or derivative.
- Using "SCP2P" (or confusingly similar names) in the **name of a product,
  company, domain, or service**.
- Using the official logos or wordmarks in marketing material, storefronts, or
  advertising.

## 4. Forks and derivatives

Forks are welcome — that is the purpose of open-source licensing. If you fork
this project:

1. **Rename** your fork to something clearly distinct (e.g., "MyP2P", "FooNet").
2. Remove or replace official logos and wordmarks.
3. Retain the copyright notice and `NOTICE` file as required by the MPL-2.0.
4. You may state *"forked from SCP2P"* for attribution.

A fork that follows these guidelines does **not** need trademark permission.

## 5. Enforcement

Tech Art Ltd reserves the right to revoke any trademark permission and to take
action against misleading or infringing uses of the SCP2P name and branding.
